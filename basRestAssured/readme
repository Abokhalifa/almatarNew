Sequence
1. Send a flight search request.
2. Select a ranom flight record from the response. 
3. Make sure that the selected flight is still available/valid.
4. If it is valid, then request the details of this flight.
5. If it is not valid i.e. no longer available, then select a different flight.
6. Keep selecting another random flight from the list for as many time as the 
number of the flights in the search response.
7. If all the flights tried are not available/valid, then start over i.e. 
send a search request again and start over the cycle.
